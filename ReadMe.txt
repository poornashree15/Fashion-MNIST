Overview
========

This project, completed by Team 4 - Poornashree and Gayathri, explores convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Artificial Neural Network(ANN) using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. It includes Jupyter notebooks, Ppt and summary report. The project can be run in any Jupyter notebook-supporting environment, such as Jupyter Lab or Google Colab.

Libraries Used
==============

This project uses the following libraries commonly found in Jupyter notebook environments:
- **PyTorch**: For defining and training neural networks.
- **torchvision**: Contains datasets and transformations for Fashion-MNIST.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and feature maps.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data processing and analysis.

Instructions
============
1. **Unzip the Folder**: Extract the contents of the ZIP archive.
2. Import the 'Fashion MNIST' dataset from torchvision.dataset before running the Jupyter file.
3. **Run Jupyter Notebooks**: Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment to run and explore the code.

Conclusion
==========
This project provides a comprehensive look at  Artificial Neural Network(ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to Fashion-MNIST dataset. It offers code, Ppt and summary report to help understand and visualize the neural networks training process. The project's structure allows for further exploration and experimentation with different architectures and training parameters.
